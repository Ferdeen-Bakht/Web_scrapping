Family Groups During Umrah or Hajj Fatima, separated from her family during prayer, uses Mushaba to locate her brother 230 meters away near Gate 14 and easily reunites. Her father, less tech-savvy, gets directions via a photo shared by her brother. Group Tour Operators & Hajj Agencies A Hajj agency's guide, acting as the Mushaba admin for a group of 50, tracks all pilgrims in real-time. This drastically reduces lost-person incidents, enhancing safety and client satisfaction. Elderly Pilgrims or First-Time Travelers Mohammed, 68, from Indonesia, gets lost. He uses the "Ping" button, alerting his group with his location and a photo. The nearest group member finds him within minutes, eliminating panic. Families with Children During Tawaf, if a child briefly moves out of sight, parents can instantly see their precise location on the map and reunite quickly, turning a potentially chaotic situation into a swift and peaceful resolution. 🕌 📍 👥 🗺️ Why Mushaba Matters "Mushaba isn't just a navigation app — it's a lifeline in crowded spiritual environments. It helps pilgrims focus on faith, knowing they're always one tap away from reuniting with loved ones.

The product includes a high-efficiency solar panel paired with a smart micro inverter capable of powering essential home appliances such as three LED lights, two fans, and multiple mobile chargers. The Energy Challenge Problem Statement In many cities and regions, energy infrastructure is overwhelmed by growing population and rising demand. Unscheduled load shedding, unstable voltage, and long-duration outages are not only inconvenient but also harmful to health, productivity, and safety. Most conventional solar systems are complex, costly, space-consuming, and require specialized installation. The EASY Solar Solution Simple, Reliable Solar IOTFIY EASY Solar directly addresses this problem by offering a compact, standalone solar panel system that provides uninterrupted energy for essential needs — lighting, ventilation, and mobile communication. Designed with simplicity and durability in mind, it's ideal for urban and rural environments. Key Features Power for Daily Essentials EASY Solar is specifically engineered to power the devices that matter most when the grid goes down. It can reliably support three LED lights, two fans, and multiple phone chargers simultaneously. Smart Micro Inverter At the heart of the system is a built-in micro inverter that intelligently converts DC energy from the solar panel into stable AC power, ensuring compatibility with standard home appliances. Auto-Cleaning Technology One of the most common reasons solar panels underperform is due to accumulated dust and debris. EASY Solar solves this with a built-in auto-cleaning feature that maximizes sunlight absorption. Plug-and-Play Installation EASY Solar is designed for everyday people — not engineers. It's lightweight, wall-mountable, and doesn't require complicated wiring. Users simply plug it into a compatible socket. Eco-Friendly and Cost-Effective Switching to EASY Solar reduces reliance on fossil fuels, lowers electricity bills, and provides a reliable alternative to fuel-based generators.
